## What is Corrupted?
Corrupted is a retro-themed RPG project created to spread awareness about mental health and overall internet safety; and utilizing custom-made graphics, unique combat styles, and streamlined gameplay, players are prompted to explore the bigger questions of life, while still picking up and enjoying every unique level and story scenario. They can even look back fondly on some of the "good old days" in the process, learning important details about themselves, their actions, and life in general.
