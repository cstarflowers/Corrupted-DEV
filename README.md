## What is Corrupted?
Corrupted is a retro-themed RPG project created to spread awareness about mental health and overall internet safety. From utilizing custom-made graphics to unique combat styles and streamlined gameplay, we hope through this project to ultimately prompt players to explore the greater questions of life, while still picking up and enjoying every unique level and story scenario. They can look back on the nostalgia-filled memories of their past fondly, while still making the crucial acknowledgement that their actions will always have consequences, and that it's up to all of us to live as amazing as we can :)
